# Skill: Writing Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)

**Goal**: Clarify and illuminate specific topics.

## content_rules

- **Context Provider**: Discuss the background, the "why," and the bigger picture.
- **Discursive**: Allow for connections between differing concepts.
- **No Code**: Avoid code blocks unless used for high-level architectural illustration.
- **Permanence**: Write content that changes slowly. Focus on design decisions.
- **Justification**: Explain why the software works the way it does.

## structure

Explanation is the most loosely structured quadrant. It is discursive and essay-like — do not impose a rigid sequence. The following is a suggested flow, not a template to fill in:

- **Topic**: Name the concept being discussed and why it warrants explanation.
- **Background**: Provide contextual or historical information that helps the reader place this concept.
- **Details**: Explore the mechanics, philosophy, or trade-offs in depth. Allow for digressions and connections between ideas.
- **Related**: Link outward to specific Reference or How-to docs. Do not inline their content — cross-reference instead.

Adjust as needed: some explanations need no background; others need no "related" section. The measure of a good explanation is whether the reader comes away understanding _why_, not whether it followed a specific structure.
