# Skill: Writing How-to Guides (Problem-Oriented)

**Goal**: Show the user how to solve a specific problem they already have.

## content_rules

- **Problem Focus**: Start with the specific problem or real-world use case.
- **Assumed Competence**: Assume the user knows the basics. Do not explain "what" things are, only "how" to use them.
- **Flexibility**: Unlike tutorials, acknowledge that the user might be adapting this to their own setup.
- **External Links**: If a concept requires explanation, link to an _Explanation_ document.

## structure

1. **Goal**: "How to [Task Name]"
2. **Context**: A single sentence on when this is useful.
3. **Steps**: A series of steps to achieve the goal. Steps can be less granular than tutorials.
4. **Result**: What the final state looks like.
