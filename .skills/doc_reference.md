# Skill: Writing Technical Reference (Information-Oriented)

**Goal**: Describe the machinery accurately.

## content_rules

- **Map of Territory**: Function strictly as a map. Describe classes, functions, API endpoints, commands, or configurations.
- **Austerity**: Be dry, accurate, and concise. Avoid examples unless necessary for syntax clarity.
- **Completeness**: Strive for 100% technical accuracy. Ask the user for context if it is missing.
- **One-to-One**: Ensure the structure of the documentation mirrors the structure of the code/software.
- **No Instruction**: Do not tell the user "how" to use the feature. Link to a _How-to_ guide for that.

## structure

- **Lists and Tables**: Prioritize structured data formats over paragraphs.
- **Signature/Type**: Clearly state inputs, outputs, types, and defaults.
- **Description**: Technical description of functionality.
