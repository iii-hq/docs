This Quickstart will show how any project can leverage iii and the iii SDK to unify their backend stack.

### 1. Create a new quickstart project

<Callout title="install iii" type="warn">
  Make sure to install iii-cli and iii before proceeding:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii-cli/main/install.sh | sh
iii-cli update
```
</Callout>

The project setup will indicate that this project includes TypeScript, Python, and Rust languages. The README contains instructions for using Docker Compose in case not all of these runtimes are available on the system.

```bash
iii-cli create --template quickstart --directory quickstart
cd quickstart
```

### 2. Run the Engine

```bash
iii --config iii-config.yaml
```

### 3. Open the project

Open the project and README in your IDE. You can use this shorthand from a second terminal window in the project directory:

<Tabs items={['VS Code', 'Cursor', 'JetBrains', 'Sublime', 'Neovim']}>
  <Tab value="VS Code">

```bash
code . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Cursor">

```bash
cursor . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JetBrains">

```bash
idea . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Sublime">

```bash
subl . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Neovim">

```bash
nvim README.md
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Continue with the README

The README will explain what the project is doing and how to quickly start up
the services that will connect to the iii engine and use it for their communication.

After completing the project, explore the `worker.ts` file from the project
directory and then navigate back here to learn more about how iii works and can be
used to streamline backend orchestration.

### 5. Try the iii Console

iii also comes with a brand new web console that provides complete observability of a iii daemon.
Install and start it in a new terminal window with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/console/main/install.sh | sh
iii-console
```

Then open your web browser to: http://localhost:3113/
