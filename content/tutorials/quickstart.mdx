{/* <Callout title="Install iii" type="info">
  If you haven't installed iii yet then first run `curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh` and verify the
  installation with `iii --version`
</Callout> */}

The advantage of iii is that it transforms a backend from behaving like a series of separate concerns, domains, and services to behaving like one cohesive and interoperable application.

This Quickstart will show how any project can leverage iii and the iii SDK to unify their stack.

### 1. Create a new quickstart project

<Callout title="iii is in alpha" type="warn">
  iii is under very active development. We will have a much more streamlined onboarding experience shortly.
</Callout>

The project setup will indicate that this project includes TypeScript, Python, and Rust languages. The README contains instructions about using Docker Compose in case not all are available on the system.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/iii-hq/cli-tooling/releases/latest/download/quickstart.zip
unzip quickstart.zip
cd quickstart
```

{/* ```bash
iii-cli create --template quickstart my-iii-backend
cd my-iii-backend
``` */}

### 2. Run the Engine

```bash
iii --config iii-config.yaml
```

### 3. Open the project

Open the project and README in your IDE. You can use this shorthand from a second terminal window in the project directory:

<Tabs items={['VS Code', 'Cursor', 'JetBrains', 'Sublime', 'Neovim']}>
  <Tab value="VS Code">

```bash
code . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Cursor">

```bash
cursor . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JetBrains">

```bash
idea . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Sublime">

```bash
subl . README.md
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Neovim">

```bash
nvim README.md
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Continue with the README

The README will explain what the project is doing and how to quickly start up
the services that will connect to the iii engine and use it for their communication.

After completing the project, explore the `worker.ts` file from the project
directory and then navigate back here to learn more about how iii works and can be
used to streamline backend orchestration.

### 5. Try the iii Console

<Callout title="iii is in alpha" type="warn">
  iii is under very active development. We will be regularly updating both it and iii console to address any issues.
</Callout>

iii also comes with a brand new web console that provides complete observability of a iii daemon.
Install and start it in a new terminal window with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/console/main/install.sh | sh
iii-console
```

Then open your web browser to: http://localhost:3113/
