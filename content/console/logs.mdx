The Logs page provides a viewer for structured OpenTelemetry logs collected by the engine. Each entry shows a timestamp, severity level, service name, trace/span context, and message. A severity filter toggle, full-text search, and time-range controls let you zero in on specific log entries quickly. The source breakdown at the bottom of the page shows which services are contributing the most log volume.

  Log collection requires the Observability module with `logs_enabled: true`. See [Observability Module](/docs/modules/module-observability) for configuration.
