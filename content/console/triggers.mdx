The Triggers page shows every trigger registered with the engine and provides interactive tools to test each trigger type. Triggers are grouped by kind (HTTP, CRON, QUEUE) with a total count badge and per-type filter tabs at the top.

## Trigger List

All registered triggers are displayed with their details:

| Column       | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Type         | The trigger type: `http`, `cron`, `event`, `state`, etc. |
| Function     | The function this trigger invokes                        |
| Path / Config | HTTP path, cron schedule, or event name                 |
| Status       | Active, Error, or Inactive                               |

## Testing HTTP Triggers

For HTTP-type triggers, the console provides a built-in request builder:

1. Select the **HTTP method** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
2. The **path** is pre-filled from the trigger configuration
3. Add **query parameters** as key-value pairs
4. Enter a **request body** (for POST/PUT/PATCH) as JSON
5. Click **Send** to execute the request

The response is displayed inline with status code, headers, and body.

### Example

For a trigger registered at `POST /api/users`:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

The console sends the request through the engine's REST API module and shows the response.

## Testing Cron Triggers

Cron triggers display their schedule expression (e.g. `0 */5 * * * *`). You can:

- View the configured schedule
- Click **Trigger Now** to manually fire the cron job immediately

This is useful for testing scheduled tasks without waiting for the next scheduled run.

## Testing Event Triggers

For event-type triggers, the console provides an event emitter:

1. The **event name** is pre-filled from the trigger configuration
2. Enter a **payload** as JSON
3. Click **Emit** to publish the event

The engine dispatches the event and invokes the connected function.

  The available trigger types depend on which modules are loaded in your engine configuration. See [Trigger Types](/docs/trigger-types) and [Modules](/docs/modules) for the full list.
