The Flow page renders an interactive graph of your system's architecture, showing how triggers, functions, state stores, and queues connect.

<Callout title="Feature flag required" type="warn">
  The Flow page is an opt-in feature. Enable it by starting the console with the `--enable-flow` flag or setting the `III_ENABLE_FLOW` environment variable.
</Callout>

## Enabling Flow

```bash
# Via CLI flag
iii-console --enable-flow

# Via environment variable
III_ENABLE_FLOW=true iii-console
```

## Graph Visualization

The flow diagram uses an auto-layout algorithm (Dagre) to arrange nodes and edges. The graph includes several node types:

| Node Type   | Description                          | Visual           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| HTTP Trigger | REST API endpoint triggers          | Colored by method |
| Cron Trigger | Scheduled triggers                  | Clock icon        |
| Event Trigger | Event-driven triggers              | Lightning icon    |
| Function    | Registered functions                 | Code icon         |
| State       | Key-value state stores               | Database icon     |
| Queue       | Queue nodes                          | List icon         |

Edges show the data flow direction between components — from triggers to the functions they invoke, and from functions to the state or queues they interact with.

## Interaction

- **Pan and zoom** — scroll to zoom, drag to pan
- **Click a node** — view its details (function ID, trigger config, etc.)
- **Auto-layout** — the graph arranges itself automatically using a directed-graph layout

## Configuration Persistence

Flow layout configuration is saved to the engine's state store. The next time you open the Flow page, it restores the previous view state.
