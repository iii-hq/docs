The Traces page provides full OpenTelemetry trace visualization with multiple view modes, advanced filtering, and detailed span inspection. The list view shows each trace with its operation name, short trace ID, duration, service name, and timestamp — along with a rich filter bar covering status, time range, duration, service, operation, and span attributes.

<Callout title="Observability module required" type="info">
  Trace collection requires the Observability module with `exporter` set to `memory` or `both`. See [Observability Module](/docs/modules/module-observability) for configuration.

## Trace List

The main view shows collected traces with:

| Column    | Description                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Trace ID  | Unique identifier (click to expand)            |
| Service   | The service that produced the trace            |
| Root Span | The top-level operation name                   |
| Duration  | Total trace duration                           |
| Status    | OK, Error, or Pending                          |
| Spans     | Number of spans in the trace                   |
| Timestamp | When the trace started                         |

## View Modes

Click on a trace to open the detail view. Four visualization modes are available:

### Waterfall Chart

A timeline view showing every span laid out horizontally by start time and duration. This is the default view and is best for understanding the sequential and parallel flow of operations.

### Flame Graph

A stack-based visualization where each span is stacked on its parent. Wider bars indicate longer duration. Useful for identifying which operations consume the most time.

### Service Breakdown

Groups spans by service name and shows aggregate statistics per service: total spans, average duration, and error rate. Useful for identifying which service is the bottleneck.

### Trace Map

A topology graph showing how services communicate. Nodes represent services and edges represent span parent-child relationships across service boundaries. Useful for understanding distributed call patterns.

## Span Details

Click on any span in the waterfall or flame graph to open the detail panel:

| Tab       | Content                                             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Info      | Span name, service, duration, status, trace/span IDs |
| Tags      | All span attributes as key-value pairs              |
| Logs      | Events and log entries attached to the span         |
| Errors    | Error messages, stack traces, and exception details |
| Baggage   | Trace context baggage key-value pairs               |

## Filtering

The Traces page supports advanced filtering to narrow results:

| Filter       | Description                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trace ID     | Search by exact trace ID                                   |
| Service Name | Filter by service name (substring match)                   |
| Span Name    | Filter by span/operation name (substring match)            |
| Status       | Filter by status: OK, Error, or Pending                    |
| Duration     | Min and max duration range in milliseconds                 |
| Time Range   | Start and end time window                                  |
| Attributes   | Filter by span attributes as key-value pairs (AND logic)   |

Multiple filters are combined with AND logic. Pagination controls at the bottom allow browsing large result sets.
