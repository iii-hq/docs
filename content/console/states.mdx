The States page provides a browser for the engine's key-value state store. You can view, create, edit, and delete state entries organized by scope. The layout is divided into three panels: a group list on the left, an items table in the center, and a detail sidebar on the right showing the full JSON value of the selected item.

## State Browser

The state browser displays a two-level hierarchy:

1. **Groups (Scopes)** — top-level namespaces that organize state
2. **Items** — individual key-value pairs within each group

### Viewing State

Select a group from the left panel to see all its key-value items. Each item shows:

| Column | Description                                    |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Key    | The item key within the scope                  |
| Value  | The stored value, rendered as formatted JSON   |

Complex values (objects, arrays) are displayed in a collapsible JSON viewer.

### Adding State

1. Click **Add Item**
2. Enter the **scope** (group name) and **key**
3. Enter the **value** as JSON
4. Click **Save**

The item is persisted via `state::set` and appears in the browser immediately.

### Editing State

1. Click on an existing item
2. Modify the JSON value in the editor
3. Click **Save**

The update fires `state:updated` triggers if any are registered for that scope/key.

### Deleting State

1. Click the delete icon on an item
2. Confirm the deletion

The deletion fires `state:deleted` triggers if any are registered.

<Callout title="State persistence" type="info">
  State persistence depends on your engine's State module configuration. With `in_memory` storage, state is lost on engine restart. With `file_based` or `RedisAdapter`, state persists across restarts. See [State Module](/docs/modules/module-state) for configuration details.

## Search and Pagination

Use the search bar to filter items by key name. For groups with many items, the browser supports pagination.
