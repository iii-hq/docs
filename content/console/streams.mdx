The Streams page lists all streams registered in the iii engine and provides metadata about each one.

## Stream Discovery

The page displays every stream in the system:

| Column   | Description                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Name     | The stream identifier                               |
| Group    | The consumer group the stream belongs to            |
| Type     | Whether the stream is user-defined or system-internal |

Use the filter toggle to show or hide **system streams** (internal streams used by the engine itself).

## Real-Time Monitoring

Streams update in real time via WebSocket. As new streams are created or existing ones receive data, the list refreshes automatically.

  Streams are provided by the Stream module. Make sure `modules::stream::StreamModule` is included in your engine configuration. See [Stream Module](/docs/modules/module-stream) for details.
