The Functions page lists every function registered with the iii engine and lets you invoke any of them directly with custom JSON input. Functions are grouped by their service namespace and show a total count badge in the header.

## Function List

All registered functions are displayed with their metadata:

| Column      | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Function ID | The fully qualified path (e.g. `my.service.handler`)  |
| Triggers    | Number and types of triggers attached to the function |
| Workers     | Worker processes that can execute the function        |
| Status      | Current function status                               |

Use the **search bar** at the top to filter functions by name.

## Invoking Functions

You can invoke any function directly from the console:

<Image src="/console/functions-invoke.png" alt="Function invoke panel showing JSON input editor and response output" />

1. Click on a function to open its detail panel
2. Enter a JSON payload in the input editor
3. Click **Invoke**
4. View the result or error in real time

This is useful for:

- **Testing** a function during development without wiring up a trigger
- **Debugging** by sending specific payloads to reproduce an issue
- **Ad-hoc operations** like running a migration function manually

### Example

To invoke a function `users.getProfile`:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-123"
}
```

The console sends the payload to the engine via `POST /_console/invoke` and displays the JSON response or error inline.

<Callout title="Function must be registered" type="info">
  Only functions that are currently registered and connected via an active worker will appear in the list. If a function is missing, check that its worker process is running.
</Callout>
