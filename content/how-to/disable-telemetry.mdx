iii collects aggregated anonymous usage data to help improve the engine.
No personal information is collected unless provided by you. Use this guide to opt out.

## Steps

Set the following environment variable before running iii:

```bash
export III_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

To make this permanent, add it to your shell profile (e.g. `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
echo 'export III_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Result

iii will no longer send any telemetry data.
