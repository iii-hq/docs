Triggers are entrypoints into an iii system.

Each Trigger defines the conditions which will cause it to fire, a payload it accepts, and a Function that it will trigger. When the Trigger fires, the Function is executed with that payload.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User((User)) -->|request| Trigger

    subgraph Trigger[Trigger]
        Config["POST /users"]
    end
    subgraph Function[Function]
        Fn["users::create"]
    end
    Trigger -->|triggers| Function
```

  Due to the way iii is structured there can be any amount of entrypoints into a system. This makes modification
  simpler, reduces complexity, and allows the adoption of any programming pattern into existing infrastructure.
