Functions are an abstraction on anything that can be called such as an actual function, or an endpoint. As a result they can run anywhere, be written in any language, and use anything available to the iii engine. This makes it possible to incorporate existing systems into the Engine by registering them with the Engine as Function(s).

They accept a payload, and a context object, perform operations, and return a result.

The payload is the data passed to the function by its caller.

The context object is how you access full system functionality such as state, logging, databasing, and invoking other functions. If the iii engine has access to it, the context object will contain it.

The diagram below is simplified but the end result is the same.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Caller((Caller)) -->|"payload (optional)"| Fn

    subgraph Function[Function]
        Fn[create_user]
        Fn --> P1["Process Request"]
    end

    P1 -.->|optional| Response(("Response"))
```

<Callout title="Everything is a Function" type="info">
  Traditionally the backend has a mental model where functionality is separated by domain. For example a HTTP endpoint
  is an endpoint, not a function, despite being defined as a Function within any HTTP framework. iii's approach removes
  this arbitrary separation and the benefits that iii provides derive from that.
