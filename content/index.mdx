**iii** (pronounced "three eye") is a long-running backend engine. You start it once, and it runs continuously — dynamically registering Functions from Workers as they connect, orchestrating triggers, and providing shared functionality (state, queues, streams, observability) to everything in the system.

## What iii does

When iii starts, it:

- **Dynamically registers Functions** — Workers connect over WebSocket and register their handlers. iii routes incoming triggers to the right Worker, regardless of language or location.
- **Orchestrates triggers** — HTTP requests, cron schedules, queue messages, state changes, and stream events all flow through iii and invoke the correct Function.
- **Provides shared functionality** — State, queues, streams, and observability are available to every Function through the same `trigger()` API, no matter where the Function is running.
- **Manages the lifecycle** — When a Worker disconnects, iii cleans up its Functions automatically. When it reconnects, Functions are re-registered transparently.

This makes iii the single coordination point for your entire backend — APIs, background jobs, workflows, queues, and state — without any of the complexity of managing those systems separately.

  React revolutionized the frontend with the Component and Context. Rust revolutionized systems programming with
  Ownership and Borrowing. iii hopes to do the same on the backend with Function and Trigger.

## Getting Started

The best way to understand iii is to try it:

### 1. Install iii

Get the iii daemon installed on your machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh
```

<Callout title="Anonymous telemetry" type="info">
  iii collects anonymous usage data to help improve the engine. No personal information is collected. To opt out, set the environment variable before running iii:

  ```bash
  III_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false iii
  ```
</Callout>

### 2. Verify installation

Check that iii has installed correctly with the following command. It should return a version number.

```bash
iii --version
```
