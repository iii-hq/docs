**iii** (pronounced "three eye") is a backend engine that unifies your entire infrastructure—APIs, background jobs, workflows, queues, state, and everything else—into a single, durable runtime.

The engine model creates a "Modular Monolith" that scales like microservices but removes their architectural complexity which makes your application feel and behave like a cohesive whole no matter where it is running.

It creates this experience by transforming every backend operation into two core concepts: Call and Register. These concepts are the mechanism by which most architectural complexity is removed.

  React revolutionized the frontend with the Component and Context. Rust revolutionized systems programming with
  Ownership and Borrowing. iii hopes to do the same on the backend with Call and Register.

## Getting Started

The best way to understand iii is to try it:

### 1. Install iii

Get the iii daemon installed on your machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Verify installation

Check that iii has installed correctly with the following command. It should return a version number.

```bash
iii --version
```
