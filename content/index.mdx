# Welcome to iii

**iii** (pronounced "three eye") is a backend engine that unifies your entire infrastructure—APIs, background jobs, workflows, queues, state, and everything else—into a single, durable runtime.

The engine model creates a "Modular Monolith" that scales like microservices but removes their architectural complexity which makes your application feel and behave like a cohesive whole no matter where it is running.

It creates this experience by transforming every backend operation into two core primitives: Triggers and Functions. These primitives are the mechanism by which most architectural complexity is removed.

<Callout title="The Paradigm Shift" type="info">
  If React revolutionized the frontend with the Component then iii intends to do the same on the backend with Triggers
  and Functions.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

The best way to understand the implications of this model is to try it out:

### 1. Install iii

Get the toolchain installed on your machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL iii.sh/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Initialize a Project

```bash
iii init --template quickstart my-new-backend
cd my-new-backend
```

### 3. Run the Engine

Start iii.

```bash
iii --config dev.yaml
```
