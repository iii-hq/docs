title: Welcome to iii
description: One engine. Three primitives. Your entire backend.
hideCards: true

**iii** (pronounced "three eye") replaces your backend stack with a single engine and three primitives: **Worker**, **Function**, and **Trigger**.

No more gluing together separate tools for APIs, queues, cron, state, and real-time. iii gives you all of that out of the box.

## The Problem

Building a typical backend today means stitching together 5-10 separate systems: an API framework, a task queue, a cron scheduler, a pub/sub layer, a state store, a WebSocket server, and an observability pipeline. Each one has its own setup, its own deployment, and its own failure modes. You spend more time wiring infrastructure than writing business logic.

## How iii Solves It

You start iii once. It runs as a single process and handles everything:

- **Write functions in any language.** Your code runs in Workers that connect to iii over WebSocket. Use TypeScript, Python, or Rust. Mix them freely.
- **Triggers replace all your infra wiring.** An HTTP request, a cron schedule, a queue message, a state change, a stream event. They all work the same way: a Trigger fires, iii invokes your Function.
- **Discovery keeps every worker in sync.** When a Worker connects and registers its Functions, every other Worker is notified. When it disconnects, its Functions disappear. No service registry, no config files — every Worker always knows what the entire system can do.
- **Workers come and go.** When a Worker connects, its Functions are registered automatically. When it disconnects, they are cleaned up. When it reconnects, everything is restored. Zero-downtime deploys become trivial.

The result: you write business logic as Functions, declare what triggers them, and iii handles the rest.

## What iii Does

When iii starts, it:

- **Dynamically registers Functions.** Workers connect over WebSocket and register their handlers. iii routes incoming triggers to the right Worker, regardless of language or location.
- **Orchestrates triggers.** HTTP requests, cron schedules, queue messages, state changes, and stream events all flow through iii and invoke the correct Function.
- **Enables runtime discovery.** Every Worker can see every Function in the system, including built-in ones. When a Worker connects or disconnects, the registry updates and everyone is notified.
- **Manages the lifecycle.** When a Worker disconnects, iii cleans up its Functions automatically. When it reconnects, Functions are re-registered transparently.

<Callout title="Why this matters" type="info">
  React simplified the frontend with Component and Context. iii does the same for the backend with Function, Trigger, and Discovery. One mental model for APIs, background jobs, workflows, real-time, and more.

## Getting Started

The best way to understand iii is to try it:

### 1. Install iii

Get the iii daemon installed on your machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh
```

<Callout title="Anonymous telemetry" type="info">
  iii collects anonymous usage data to help improve the engine. No personal information is collected. To opt out, set the environment variable before running iii:

  ```bash
  III_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false iii
  ```
</Callout>

### 2. Verify installation

Check that iii has installed correctly with the following command. It should return a version number.

```bash
iii --version
```
