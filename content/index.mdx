**iii** (pronounced "three eye") is a backend engine that unifies your entire infrastructure (APIs, background jobs, workflows, queues, state, and everything else) into a single, durable runtime.

The engine model creates a "Modular Monolith" that scales like microservices but removes their architectural complexity which makes your application feel and behave like a cohesive whole no matter where it is running.

It creates this experience by transforming every backend operation into two core concepts: **Function** and **Trigger**. These concepts are the mechanism by which most architectural complexity is removed.

<Callout title="The Paradigm Shift" type="info">
  React revolutionized the frontend with the Component and Context. Rust revolutionized systems programming with
  Ownership and Borrowing. iii hopes to do the same on the backend with Function and Trigger.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

The best way to understand iii is to try it:

### 1. Install iii

Get the iii daemon installed on your machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.iii.dev/iii/main/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Verify installation

Check that iii has installed correctly with the following command. It should return a version number.

```bash
iii --version
```
