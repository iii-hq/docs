# Welcome to iii

**iii** (pronounced "Three Eye") is the Universal Backend Engine. It unifies your entire infrastructure—APIs, background jobs, workflows, queues, state, and everything else—into a single, durable runtime.

**iii** gives you a "Modular Monolith" that scales like microservices but is as easy to build as a single application.

**iii** centralizes the architecture of your backend and removes complexity by transforming every backend operation into two core primitives: Triggers and Functions. These primitives are the mechanism by which complexity is removed.

<Callout title="The Paradigm Shift" type="info">
  If React revolutionized the frontend with the Component then iii intends to do the same on the backend with Triggers
  and Functions.
</Callout>

## Why use iii?

Modern backend development imposes a heavy "Infrastructure Tax." **iii** removes the glue code and gives you a unified engine that handles the plumbing for you.

    Forget managing event listeners and queues. Define your logic as **Triggers** and **Functions**, and let the engine
    handle the orchestration.

  <Card icon={<Repeat />} title="Durable Execution" href="/features/reliability">
    Sleep easy. All processes are durable by default. If your server crashes or restarts, iii resumes your workflows
    exactly where they left off—no data lost.

  <Card icon={<Box />} title="Infrastructure Agnostic" href="/concepts/deployment">
    Run anywhere. Whether it's a Raspberry Pi in your basement, a Docker container on a VPS, or a serverless
    function—the engine runs your code consistently.

    Zero-config telemetry. See the full lifecycle of a request—from API trigger to background job to database update—in

## Getting Started

You are minutes away from your first durable workflow.

### 1. Install the CLI

Get the toolchain installed on your machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL iii.sh/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Initialize a Project

Create a new project scaffolding with TypeScript support out of the box.

```bash
iii init my-new-backend
cd my-new-backend
```

### 3. Run the Engine

Start the local development engine. This spins up the runtime, dashboard, and worker processes.

```bash
iii dev
```
