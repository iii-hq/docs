---

This module is used to execute commands in the shell. Add as many instances of this 
module as you need to execute commands in the shell.

```
modules::shell::ExecModule
```

## Sample Configuration

```yaml
  - class: modules::shell::ExecModule
    config:
      exec:
        - bun run --enable-source-maps index-production.js
```

## Configuration

<ResponseField name="exec" type="string[]">
  The commands to execute. It's a pipeline, it will run one after the other in the same folder. The commands are all executed in different processes.
  Which means you cannot connect commands like 
  
  ```bash
  - cd path/to/project
  - npm run build
  ```
  Instead, you need to connect them under the same command line.

  ```bash
  - cd path/to/project && npm run build
  ```
</ResponseField>
