Triggers connect Trigger Types to Functions, creating the link between events and execution.

## What are Triggers?

A **Trigger** is a configured instance of a **Trigger Type** that routes invocations to a specific **Function**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    TriggerType[Trigger Type<br/>e.g., 'api'] -->|+Configuration| Trigger[Trigger<br/>POST /users]
    Trigger -->|Routes to| Function[Function<br/>users.create]
```

**Key Concept**: Triggers decouple _what initiates an action_ (Trigger Type) from _what logic runs_ (Function).
