title: 'Triggers'
---

Triggers subscribe to and define triggering conditions for events. When the Trigger's conditions are met it informs the iii engine that Function(s) need to be called with the payload of the event.

From the application developer standpoint it functions something like this. Although there are a few more layers inbetween.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Event((Event<br/>POST /users)) -->|fires| Trigger
    subgraph Trigger[Trigger]
        Config[subscribe: POST /users]
    end
    subgraph Function[Function]
        Fn[create_user]
    end
    Trigger -->|calls| Function
```
