description: 'Function & Trigger are how code gets defined and executed in a iii powered backend'
---
A **Function** is anything that can be triggered to do work; it receives input, and optionally returns output.
It can exist anywhere be it locally, on cloud, on serverless, or even as a 3rd party HTTP endpoint. It can mutate state,
invoke other functions, modify databases, and do anything that a typical function can do. 
All application level Functions are treated the same within iii. 

A **Trigger** is what causes a Function to run — either explicitly from code, or automatically from an event source
like an HTTP request or cron job.

<Callout title="Uncontrolled Endpoints" type="info">
iii's Functions are not magic. While uncontrolled 3rd party HTTP endpoints can be represented as Functions they won't have
the same access to invokation, state, and databases as other Functions do.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph W1[Worker A]
        direction TB
        F1([Function A])
        F2([Function B])
    end

    W1 -- "trigger(id, data)" --> E[Engine]

    subgraph W2[Worker B]
        direction TB
        F3([Function C])
    end

    W2 -- registerFunction --> E

    F1 -- registerFunction --> E -- trigger --> W2
