iii is built around three concepts: **Function**, **Trigger**, and **Discovery**.

A **Function** is anything that can be triggered to do work; it receives input, and optionally returns output.

A **Trigger** is what causes a Function to run. It can be explicit (calling `trigger()` from code) or
automatic (HTTP request, cron schedule, queue message, state change, and more).

**Discovery** is what makes the system self-aware. When a worker connects, it can see every function 
egistered by every other worker, plus built-in functions the engine provides. No configuration files, no service
registries. This is what turns infrastructure tools into design patterns.

  We recommend starting out with quickly learning the concepts behind iii before diving in deeper.
  But if you prefer to get started building then go to the [How to use Functions and Triggers](/docs/how-to/use-functions-and-triggers) guide.
  Or if you want to learn about the deeper aspects of iii's architecture then go to the [Architecture](/docs/architecture) section.
