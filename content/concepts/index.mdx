The ultimate goal of the iii engine is to reduce the contextual overhead needed to create modern backend applications.
The result is a more ergonomic, intuitive experience when you build, integrate, maintain, and migrate software.
This is accomplished on the application side with two concepts: **Registration** and **Call**.

Registration gives the engine awareness of what your application can do.
Call gives everything in your application the ability to invoke anything else without knowing where it lives, what language it uses, or how it's deployed.
Together, they eliminate the routing, discovery, and integration logic that normally accumulates between services.
