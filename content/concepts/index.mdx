iii is built around three concepts: **Function**, **Trigger**, and **Discovery**.

A **Function** is anything that can be triggered to do work; it receives input, and optionally returns output.

A **Trigger** is what causes a Function to run. It can be explicit (calling `trigger()` from code) or
automatic (HTTP request, cron schedule, queue message, state change, and more).

**Discovery** is what makes the system self-aware. When a worker connects, it can see every function 
egistered by every other worker, plus built-in functions the engine provides. No configuration files, no service
registries. This is what turns infrastructure tools into design patterns.
