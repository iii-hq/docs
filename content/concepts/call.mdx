title: 'Call'
description: 'Invoke any registered function from anywhere in your application.'

Call runs any Function registered with the Engine. It doesn't matter where the function lives, what language it's written in, or how it was registered.

The result is a unified way to invoke any functionality accessible to the Engine.

<Callout title="Functions?" type="info">
  A Function is anything that can receive a request and (optionally) return a response. Some examples that meet this
  definition are normal methods, http endpoints, state updates, and database mutations.
