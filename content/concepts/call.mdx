Call runs any function registered with the Engine regardless of where it lives, what language it's written in,
or how it was registered.

Without Call, invoking a function across services means knowing its location, protocol, and interface.
Call removes that burden by routing every invocation through the Engine, which already holds a reference to the function.
The developer supplies the intent; the Engine handles the rest.
