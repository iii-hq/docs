### Infrastructure
- **Workers**: Consumers of the III architecture and can use all features of III
- **Core Modules**: Similar to Workers, but they live INSIDE the III Engine, can use the all features of III

### Implementation
- **Remote Functions**: Register arbitrary functions that can be executed anywhere

### Invocation
- **Trigger Types**: to configure different trigger types where triggers can be added (example: api, event, cron)
- **Triggers**: It's a link between a Trigger Type using a specific configuration, and a Remote Function.

## Understanding Architecture

III is composed of a few layers

- **Core Modules**: There are a lot of Core Modules, each one solves a specific problem.
- **Adapters**: III it built with Adapters by default, modules can have adapters to integrate with external systems.
- **Workers**: External services connected to the III Engine, can be used to trigger functions, receive events, etc.
